You only have to download/develop \nthe exporter and drop it into the <em>plugin</em> folder of <em>sharpDox</em>. The new exporter will \nbe registered during a restart of <strong>sharpDox</strong> and gets executed during the build process (find <a href=\"#/article/exporter-tutorial\">here</a> a tutorial to create an own exporter).</p> \n<p>If you provided all needed settings, the documentation is ready to build. Press <em>Build</em> to start the build process. After the successful build your documentation is located \nin the given output path. <em>sharpDox</em> creates a subfolder for each registered exporter.</p> \n<p>Have fun with <em>sharpDox</em>!</p>"}
